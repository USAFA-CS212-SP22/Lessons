    "* Describe when clustering, regression or classification is the appropriate analysis technique\n",

    "# Description\n",
    "In this case study, you will provide recommendations to leading grape growers and grape farmers who produce the finest wines in the world. Every grape grower's goal is to find the recipe for the perfect wine. Of course, this definition of the \"perfect\" wine is very subjective, so we can use wine quality reviews to help our grape growers craft the best wine. Our dataset comes from the [University of California, Irvine Machine Learning Data Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/wine).\n",
