    "An API, or Application Programming Interface, is a server that you can use to retrieve and send data to using code. APIs are most commonly used to retrieve data, and that will be the focus of this beginner tutorial.\n",
    "\n",
    "When we want to receive data from an API, we need to make a `request`. Requests are used all over the web. For instance, when you visited this blog post, your web browser made a request to the Dataquest web server, which responded with the content of this web page. \n",

The requests library isn’t part of the standard Python library, so you’ll need to install it to get started.\n",

    "\n",
    "- `200`: Everything went okay, and the result has been returned (if any).\n",
    "- `301`: The server is redirecting you to a different endpoint. This can happen when a company switches domain names, or an endpoint name is changed.\n",
    "- `400`: The server thinks you made a bad request. This can happen when you don’t send along the right data, among other things.\n",
    "- `401`: The server thinks you’re not authenticated. Many APIs require login ccredentials, so this happens when you don’t send the right credentials to access an API.\n",
    "- `403`: The resource you’re trying to access is forbidden: you don’t have the right permissions to see it.\n",
    "- `404`: The resource you tried to access wasn’t found on the server.\n",
    "- `503`: The server is not ready to handle the request.\n",
    "\n",
    "You might notice that all of the status codes that begin with a ‘4’ indicate some sort of error. The first number of status codes indicate their categorization. This is useful — you can know that if your status code starts with a ‘2’ it was successful and if it starts with a ‘4’ or ‘5’ there was an error.
